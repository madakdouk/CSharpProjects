### 21 Game
This is a C# console application that delivers an authentic experience of playing Twenty-One card game, also known as Blackjack. The application knows and enforces the rules for a fair game of Twenty-One. It uses try-catch blocks to keep cheaters out. A special code library made from scratch is used for this application. The library contains many different classes that are meant to represent real-world casino objects. The game can keep track of player's and dealer's bank and hand. It announces game results automatically when it detects the correct conditions. The player is allowed to keep playing as long as they have sufficient funds.


### Car Insurance
This MVC web application is a simple car insurance tool. The user inputs the policy information for the application to calculate a quote from the given business logic. The application also includes an admin view that shows a record of all quotes.
